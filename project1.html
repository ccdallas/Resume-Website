    <p>The purpose of this project is to build a cloud-based management system whereby students and their advisors are partners in meeting the essential learning outcomes, ensuring student academic success, and outlining the steps for achievement of the studentsâ€™ personal, academic, and career goals.</p>
    
    <p>The management system will allow administrators to track and manage both staff and students, automate daily operations, and pull relevant reports. Also, the system will include a sign-in/out process/interface for in person sessions as well as the ability to schedule appointments online.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>This project will assist in creating a portal for a university or college.</li>
        <li>This portal allows them to register students, track their placements in various companies, and view their final results. 
        </li>
        <li>While it provides separate login portals for teachers and students, it also serves as a liaison between staff, students, and companies to deliver necessary information, collect feedback, declares results, etc.
